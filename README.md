# 2048

This is a version of the game of [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) that I created in August of 2018, for my final project as part of the ICS4UE course (Computer Science 12 Online).

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, as well as using external libraries. In this case, the JDOM library was used to save high scores. 

A [user guide](./User%20Guide.pdf) is available, with instructions on how the game is played, and how to start it.

[A ZIP file of the compiled game](https://github.com/lpt0/2048/releases/tag/v1.0), along with all of the required assets and user guide, is available under the "Releases" section.
